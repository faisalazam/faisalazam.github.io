question: "Can you tell me about a time when you needed to get things done without direction or supervision?"
answer: "There had been quite a few examples, but I’ll use the implementation of API Gateway as an example. Problem
            was, our B2B gateway at that time was facing issues including long downtimes, which was not acceptable at
            all. So I was tasked to come up with the plan along with a Proof of Concept to have our own API Gateway. No
            further direction or supervision was there as that’s all I was told. So, I did some research and shortlisted
            an off the shelf product named Tyk which I could use to build my gateway on top of that instead of
            reinventing the wheel. It was developed in house to avoid purchasing expensive product from the market. So,
            I developed a proof of concept and started thinking about productionising it and that’s when I introduced
            tools like docker, ansible, vagrant, packer, nginx, log rotation etc. After having bits and pieces connected
            together, presented the whole solution to the platform head, the approach as well as the PoC was well
            received and as a result, I was given a team to work on it properly and make it production ready. Got the
            team up to speed and they got the opportunity to learn tools like ansible, docker, etc. It was deployed on
            AWS with all the latest techniques like scaling, load balancing etc. at that time. The project later became
            a product in the organisation and got used by multiple teams."
