question: "Can you briefly describe your career history?"
answer: "I’ve been in the software industry for last 15 years. Apart from technical skills, I’m certified professional
            Scrum master, scaled professional scrum as well as certified Agile practitioner from PMI. I’ve worked across
            different domains like land management, visa processing, healthcare, telecom etc. It’s been a steep learning
            curve where I just did not learn but also shared what I learnt whenever I got the opportunity.

            I’ve started my career as Software Engineer and since then, had been playing different roles. My
            cost-effective solutions with high quality deliverables as well as delivery oriented track record got
            rewarded with the career progression such as, leading the team and project, or becoming the Software
            Engineering Manager (as they knew that I’ve never been scared to take up bigger challenges).

            There had been tight deadlines, challenging requirements and complex issues from time to time, but have been
            meeting the expectations through the use of tools like communication, transparency, staying calm even under
            huge load and pressure; and then, “the approach” towards development and delivery, which means, follow the
            divide and conquer technique to split the complicated problems into small, measurable, achievable, testable
            and manageable ones, and follow Moscow technique to prioritise them to ensure delivering the best value all
            the time.

            Apart from that, I’ve also been focusing on looking for opportunities for automation which could either be
            project related or process related as well."
