question: "Can you tell me about a time when you had conflicting deadlines, what did you do?"
answer: "We usually work on projects and the timeline is always sort of packed with tasks or stories. Its just one of
            such project we were working on, when we out system got attacked by hackers. So, security definitely has got
            higher priority than whatever else is in development. To tackle that, we had to work extra hours but still
            had to cut some corners from out next project. Also had to re-prioritise to ensure that the best value will
            get delivered by the end of the project and within the timeline. That’s what had happened, but in general,
            conflicting deadlines can be almost avoid with the right level of communication, transparency and dependency
            management. So that, in most of the cases, no one else is waiting for the work to be delivered by someone
            else. It’s all about keep unlocking others before the other get to that stage. So, I’d say its about having
            the right culture and discipline in the organisation. Sure, that won’t eliminate the conflicts 100%, but
            you’ll see that they can be avoided in most of the cases."
